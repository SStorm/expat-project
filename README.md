# Expat Guide to Lithuania

Welcome to an expat guide on everything related to living in Lithuania. This page hopes to become the definitive and practical guide for everything you might need to know before making the move, and in your first months living in Lithuania.&#x20;

## Lithuania in a nutshell

If you haven't even heard about Lithuania before, a good place to start is probably the official [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania).

In a nutshell, you are looking at a fairly small (pop. \~2.7 Million) country in north-eastern Europe, bordered by Poland, Russia, Belarus and Latvia. Lithuania is a member of the European Union and uses the **Euro (â‚¬)** as the official currency. It is a safe and peaceful country with a high income economy and a reasonable (although increasing) [cost of living](the-basics/cost-of-living.md).

Lithuanians speak the [Lithuanian language](the-basics/language-crash-course.md). In the big cities, you will get by just fine with English, however a few words in the local tongue will never hurt.&#x20;

## Where to start

This guide assumes that you are thinking about making a move to Lithuania, so your best bet is to start with the "[What to expect](the-basics/what-to-expect.md)" section and go from there.
