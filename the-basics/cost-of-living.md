# Cost of Living

As expected, your cost of living will vary highly depending on your personal circumstances and preferences. This guide provides rough estimates of how much every day things will cost, so that you can have a rough idea of what to expect. Everything below assumes you will be living in Vilnius - other places will cost less in rent but everything else will stay similar.&#x20;

### How much do I need to make a month?

Everything below is net (after taxes).

#### As a single person:

**€1000** a month will _just_ about allow you to survive in Vilnius on your own. Don't expect to eat out.

**€2000** a month will allow you to afford a decent place to rent and will leave some money for fun stuff.&#x20;

**€3000+** a month allows you to live comfortably.&#x20;

#### **As a family with two children:**

Everything depends on your school / childcare choices. As you are unlikely to take your kids to a Lithuanian-speaking kindergarten or school, expect to spend at least €700 per month per child on this.&#x20;

### Renting

Expect to pay a **minimum** of **€400 a month** + utilities for a 1 bedroom flat in the cheaper soviet-era suburbs.&#x20;

Closer to the city centre you are looking at at least **€600** + utilities for a 1 bedroom place.

A prime 2 bedroom family flat in a new(ish) building in the city centre will set you back **€800-€1200** a month + utilities.

Check out the [housing section](broken-reference) for more detailed guides on renting and all the DOs and DON'Ts.

House-shares (i.e. for students) are a possibility although you generally have to find someone to share with first.&#x20;

### Transport

It is entirely possible to get around Vilnius and the other big cities entirely by public transport. Tickets are generally cheap (€0.65-€0.90 single in Vilnius). There are options for monthly tickets at very reasonable prices. Check out the [public transport](../getting-around/public-transport.md) section for details.

If you rent a place in central Vilnius, getting around on foot is the most reasonable option as most things are within walking distance.&#x20;

As with most cities nowadays, there is an abundance of E-scooters scattered around if you feel like  it (not in winter!).&#x20;

Uber operates in Vilnius and the fares are very reasonable, €10 will get you to most places.

### Utilities

Depending on the type of flat you rent, you will have to pay for: cold & hot water (separately), district heating, electricity, and gas.&#x20;

This will vary greatly based on your usage, and the heating costs in winter can be **substantial**. In the winter season, expect anywhere from €80 to €150 a month total (water + heating + electricity + gas) for a 1 bed flat.

Check out the [utility section](../housing/utilities.md) for more details.

### Phone & Broadband

Broadband usually comes with the rental flat and you don't need to take out a separate contract. You **will** need to pay for it on top of the rental price though! Fortunately, prices start at €10 per month and you generally can't get lower than 100mbps due to the widespread use of fibre internet.

Expect at least €8 per month for a mobile (cell) contract, depending on how much data you think you'll need.

Check out the [phone & broadband](../the-necessities/phone-and-broadband.md) section for more details.

### Groceries

Groceries cost about the same as anywhere else in Europe and there is abundant choice. Check out [Barbora](https://barbora.lt) for specific prices of the things you love. &#x20;

Check out the [groceries](../the-necessities/groceries.md) section for more details.

### Childcare

While state kindergartens (aka nurseries) are nearly free (you still have to pay a token amount), you will most likely be taking your kids to a private, English-speaking one. Expect to pay **€700-900** per month including meals.

Check out the [kindergartens](../education-and-childcare/kindergartens.md) section for more details.

### Healthcare

In a nutshell, healthcare is free. As an expat however, you are likely going to want to go to a private GP who definitely speaks English - expect to pay at least €50 per visit. Prescription medicines will be free or nearly free. For dental, expect to pay €50-€100 for a filling, depending on how fancy the clinic is.&#x20;

Check out the [healthcare](../the-necessities/healthcare.md) section for more details.

### Going out

Vilnius can be fairly expensive by regional standards for food and drink at bars & restaurants. Expect to pay €3-4 for a beer (they come in 0.5 litres) in the more hip establishments. A meal will set you back at least €10 in central Vilnius. For table service, tipping is expected at 10%. Double check as some places now include the service charge in your bill, in which case no tip is required (unless you feel like it). There is no tipping if you order at the bar/counter.&#x20;
