# What to Expect

So you are finding yourself in a situation where you're contemplating a big move abroad, to a country you've never even heard about before. Fortunately for you, moving to Lithuania is way less daunting than it sounds.&#x20;

### Safety

Let's get this out of the way first: Lithuania is a **very safe country**. Violent crime is rare.&#x20;

### The Weather & Geography

Lithuania enjoys 4 proper season. Summers are warm, with highs of 25-30C not unusual. Winters are cold, with lows of -20C quite possible for at least a few days. Negative Celsius for most of the winter. Spring and Autumn are hit-and-miss, but generally rainy.&#x20;

Geographically, the country is as flat as the Netherlands. Ironically, the Netherlands highest point (323m) is actually higher than Lithuania's (292m).&#x20;

You'll find plenty of lakes, with the locals hitting the lake beaches on warm summer weekends en-mass.&#x20;

The other thing you'll find plenty of is forests - with the local taking a particular liking to the  activity of mushroom-picking.&#x20;
