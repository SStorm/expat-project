# Renting a Car

If you need/want to have a car, consider short term rentals with [CityBee](https://citybee.lt/en/), who charge by the minute and the cars are scattered all over Vilnius. Walk up to one, unlock via the app, go where you want and drop it off there (restrictions apply). For the occasional drives, this tends to be by far the most cost-effective option.&#x20;
